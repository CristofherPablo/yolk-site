        <p>

           <h2>The Plot</h2>
           <p>
            <strong>Jayne Baek</strong> is barely getting by. She shuffles through fashion school, saddled with a deadbeat boyfriend, clout-chasing friends, and a wretched eating disorder that she’s not fully ready to confront. But that’s New York City, right? At least she isn’t in Texas anymore, and is finally living in a city that feels right for her.
           </p>

           <p>
               On the other hand, her sister <strong>June</strong> is dazzlingly rich with a high-flying finance job and a massive apartment. Unlike Jayne, June has never struggled a day in her life. Until she’s diagnosed with uterine cancer.

           <p>
               Suddenly, these estranged sisters who have nothing in common are living together. Because sisterly obligations are kind of important when one of you is dying.

                She had met with a number of editors and grew frustrated by the pessimism she encountered about the sales prospects for an essay collection; 
               </p>
               <p>
                   instead she accepted an offer from Amazon to write the short collection of essays as a Kindle Single for a $5000 payment plus 70% of profits, the right to set the price of the collection, and retention of full ownership of the copyright.
